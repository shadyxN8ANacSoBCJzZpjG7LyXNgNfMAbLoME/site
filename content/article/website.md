# How i made this website

## Install process:

`dnf install hugo`
go to directory, then `hugo new site ./`

i referenced https://youtu.be/hjD9jTi_DQ4 to get me started

download a theme, and set it in hugo.toml

to make a new post, or new content, `hugo new article/website.md`
this makes the md file in the content/posts folder

add an image: `![llama](/img/llama.png "llama")`

so here is what my website.md looks like so far:

tada

now, the next step is to get this running somewhere.
currently, i am just using `hugo server` and looking at it at localhost:1313

the goal is to have it so i can make changes to this site locally, test it, then do a git commit to a public git repo, and have the site built from that.

so, i need this data stored somewhere, and i need something to run the site.

the whole website info is stored in /public (in the hugo folder, run `hugo` and then it will update /public) so only this has to go to the hosting place. i will be uploading my whole hugo folder to git however.

now run  `git init` to start the git repo, and send it to a public git platform. for me it will be here:
https://github.com/shadyxN8ANacSoBCJzZpjG7LyXNgNfMAbLoME/site

then `git remote add origin https://github.com/shadyxN8ANacSoBCJzZpjG7LyXNgNfMAbLoME/site.git`
`git branch -M main`
`git push -u origin main`

and tada this line will be the second commit in the repo!!
